Dungeon Keeper 2 map tool
-------------------------------

This tool was madde to help in reverse-engineering
 of map files. It can properly parse all files that
 make up a map, and completely read some of these
 files. It still requires some work, but eventually
 it could be used to create a map editor, or a
 converter between DK1 and DK2 map formats.

Usage:
  dk2mtool <mapname> <operation>
The <mapname> should be given without extension.

Valid <operations> are:
  d: Dump file structure data
